✅ Key Features of the Dashboard

Patient Demographics Distribution

Displays age and gender distributions across different health conditions.

Treatment Success Rates by Diagnosis

Visualizes outcome performance for each medical condition.

Treatment Outcome Comparison

Compares Success, Failure, and Inconclusive outcomes.

Medical Condition by Gender and Age Group

Stacked charts highlight demographic breakdowns.

Interactive Slicers

Navigate insights by Blood Group and Insurance Provider.

🛠️ Data Preparation

Handling Missing Values

Addressed missing records with imputation and cleaning to ensure reliable insights.

Derived Columns (DAX)

Treatment Outcome: Categorized from Test Results (Normal → Success, Abnormal → Failure, Inconclusive → Inconclusive).

Age Group: Binned into categories (0–17, 18–35, 36–55, 56–75, 76+).

New Measure (DAX)

Success Rate = Ratio of successful treatments to total attempted treatments (excluding inconclusive cases).

📈 Insights & Findings

Age 0-17 has the lowest medical condition count while age 36-55 has the highest.

Success rates vary significantly by diagnosis, highlighting areas where treatment protocols could be reviewed.

Gender distribution shows conditions that are more common in either male or female patients.

Insurance provider and blood group filters allow deeper segmentation of patient populations.
